      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m both near- and farsighted, working with three screens, sometimes writing on my phone or checking my watch. Until now, I needed up to 4 pairs of #glasses at my desk. Finally, I found a pair of progressive lenses that replaces them all! So happy! üòÉalthough very expensive üòï&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry! I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to disturb your morning sunbathing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A peaceful riverside scene featuring a duck resting near the water&amp;rsquo;s edge. The foreground is filled with lush greenery and young leaves, framing the view of the calm river. In the background, a dense forest of tall trees stretches out, creating a serene and natural atmosphere. The soft morning light adds a gentle glow to the scene, highlighting the tranquility of the moment.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is Maundy Thursday. In German, it literally means &amp;ldquo;Green Thursday.&amp;rdquo; Does this mean that for us #software #developers, today we&amp;rsquo;ll stay until all tests pass?&#xA;An opportunity to check out what&amp;rsquo;s new&#xA;@germsvel.com&#xA;and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.testingliveview.com&#34;&gt;www.testingliveview.com&lt;/a&gt; and review our tests. Maybe it becomes a long &amp;amp; fun dayüò±&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elixir in Production: A Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2023-01-30-elixir-in-production/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having run Elixir and Phoenix applications in production for several years now, I can confidently say it was the right choice. The stability of the BEAM, the performance of the applications, and the developer experience are all top-notch. The ecosystem has matured, and the community is one of the most welcoming and helpful I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been a part of. If you&amp;rsquo;re building for the long term, Elixir and Phoenix are a combination that&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building for the Future with Phoenix</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2020-05-25-phoenix-rising/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I got more comfortable with Elixir, I naturally gravitated towards the Phoenix framework. Building real-time, fault-tolerant web applications with Phoenix was a game-changer. The performance and scalability were unlike anything I had experienced before. LiveView, in particular, blew my mind. The ability to build interactive, real-time user interfaces with server-rendered HTML is a testament to the power and ingenuity of the Elixir ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm: Discovering Elixir</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2018-11-10-discovering-elixir/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of working with object-oriented languages, I stumbled upon Elixir in 2012 and it was a breath of fresh air. The functional programming paradigm, the actor model, and the BEAM VM were all new concepts to me. It took some time to wrap my head around it, but the elegance and concurrency of Elixir were undeniable. It felt like I was learning to program all over again, but in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Web Revolution and the Rise of PHP</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2012-09-01-php-web-revolution/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the internet started to boom, my focus shifted to web development, and PHP was the language of the hour. It was a chaotic but exciting time. PHP made it incredibly easy to build dynamic websites. I remember the joy of seeing my code come to life in a web browser, creating interactive pages that could be accessed by anyone in the world. It was a paradigm shift from desktop applications to the global reach of the web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures in C&#43;&#43; and Object-Oriented Programming</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2011-06-20-cpp-adventures/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After mastering the basics with Pascal, I dived into the world of C++. It was a huge leap, introducing me to the complexities of memory management and the power of object-oriented programming. I remember the long nights debugging pointers and the satisfaction of finally getting a complex program to compile and run. C++ was the language that opened my eyes to the performance and control that was possible, and it laid the groundwork for much of my later career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Steps in Programming: The Pascal Days</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2010-03-15-pascal-days/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back to the late 80s, my journey into the world of programming began with Pascal. It was a structured and strongly-typed language, which made it an excellent tool for learning the fundamentals of programming. I remember spending hours in front of a Turbo Pascal IDE, mesmerized by the blue screen and the power to create something out of nothing. From simple &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; programs to more complex data structures, Pascal taught me the importance of discipline and clear logic in coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
