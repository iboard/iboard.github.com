#goodmorninginternet, #traunau
Monday, April 21 – We have to lose the weight we gained on Easter Sunday yesterday, so we walked a bigger loop today. 🚶🚶‍♀️
This image depicts a serene river scene on a clear day. The river flows gently between two lush, green banks lined with trees and shrubs. The water is calm, reflecting the blue sky and the greenery on either side. The sky above is mostly clear with a few wispy clouds, suggesting a bright and pleasant day. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and natural, capturing the beauty of a peaceful riverside environment." />
