      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-the-end-of-a-journey-the-start-of-another&#34;&gt;Introduction: The End of a Journey, The Start of Another&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every software developer has a path, a winding road of languages, frameworks, and philosophies that shapes their craft. My own journey has taken me through the structured landscapes of Pascal, the raw power of C++, and the wild, chaotic frontier of early PHP web development. For a long time, I was a journeyman, picking up tools as I needed them, solving problems, and moving on. Then came the era of frameworks, promising order, productivity, and a &amp;ldquo;right way&amp;rdquo; to build things. And for a significant part of the web&amp;rsquo;s history, the undisputed king of that era was Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review of the Remarkable Paper Pro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://remarkable.com&#34;&gt;Remarkable Paper Pro&lt;/a&gt; since 2021, and it has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. As someone who loves the feel of writing on paper but needs the convenience of digital notes, the Remarkable has been a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://iboard.github.io/images/remarkable_paper_pro.png&#34; alt=&#34;Remarkable Paper Pro&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-writing-experience&#34;&gt;The Writing Experience&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing that struck me about the Remarkable is how natural it feels to write on. The textured surface of the screen and the pressure-sensitive stylus create an experience that is remarkably close to writing on paper. There&amp;rsquo;s no lag, and the &amp;ldquo;ink&amp;rdquo; flows smoothly from the stylus. It&amp;rsquo;s a joy to use for everything from jotting down quick notes to long-form writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
