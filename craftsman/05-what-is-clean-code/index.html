        <section class="body"><p>In our journey to becoming better software craftsmen, we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the importance of clean code. But what does &ldquo;clean code&rdquo; actually mean? To get a better understanding, let&rsquo;s turn to some of the most respected figures in the software development industry and see what they have to say.</p>
<h2 id="robert-c-martin-uncle-bob">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</h2>
<p>Robert C. Martin, also known as &ldquo;Uncle Bob,&rdquo; is the author of the influential book &ldquo;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship.&rdquo; He has many insightful things to say about clean code, but one of my favorites is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote gets to the heart of what it means to be a software craftsman. It&rsquo;s not just about writing code that works; it&rsquo;s about taking pride in your work and creating something that is well-crafted and a joy to work with.</p>
<p>Uncle Bob also emphasizes that clean code is not just a &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s a necessity for any successful software project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Even bad code can function. But if code isn&rsquo;t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="martin-fowler">Martin Fowler</h2>
<p>Martin Fowler, a renowned author and speaker on software development, offers a simple yet profound definition of clean code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote highlights the importance of writing code that is readable and easy to understand. As developers, we spend far more time reading code than writing it, so it&rsquo;s crucial that the code we write is clear and expressive.</p>
<h2 id="kent-beck">Kent Beck</h2>
<p>Kent Beck, the creator of Extreme Programming and one of the original signatories of the Agile Manifesto, has a more pragmatic take on clean code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a great programmer; I&rsquo;m just a good programmer with great habits.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote reminds us that writing clean code is not about being a &ldquo;genius&rdquo; programmer; it&rsquo;s about developing good habits and consistently applying them to your work.</p>
<h2 id="grady-booch">Grady Booch</h2>
<p>Grady Booch, a pioneer in object-oriented design, provides a more descriptive definition of clean code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer&rsquo;s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote gives us a clear picture of what clean code should look like: simple, direct, and easy to read, like a well-written piece of prose.</p>
<h2 id="bjarne-stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</h2>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, offers a comprehensive definition of clean code that touches on several important aspects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward and make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote provides a great checklist of things to strive for when writing clean code: elegance, efficiency, clarity, and a focus on doing one thing well.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-clean-code-look-like-to-you">What Does Clean Code Look Like to You?</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are many different perspectives on what it means to write clean code. But they all share a common thread: a commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and professionalism.</p>
<p>So, what does clean code look like to you? What are some of the principles and practices that you follow to write clean, maintainable code? Share your thoughts with <a href="mailto:andi+tpk@iboard.cc?subject=TPK%20-%20Clean%20Code">me</a>.</p>
