# Edit .html.erb only

[iboard.github.io](http://iboard.github.io)

This is the source to generate my github-page `iboard.github.com`.

You can easily

  * fork this project
  * edit files in `pages/*html.erb`
  * edit files in `templates/*`
  * run `rake` # will generate static web-pages and opens index.html
  * run `rake -T` to see more rake-task
