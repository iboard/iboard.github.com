      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunday, March 16, over the Traun River. The rain has already stopped. The beavers were very busy on both banks.&#xA;A slightly gray sky over the tranquil Traun River. Plenty of beaver damage on both banks.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saturday, March 15. More clouds and more rain than yesterday. The river starts floating just as expected from a river.&#xA;Saturday morning on the Traun Bridge. More rain and a gray sky. The river is starting to flow again.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Friday, March 14. Finally, the rain is here. It&amp;rsquo;s not much but the river is flowing again. In the last few days, it looks more like a lake than a river.&#xA;Friday morning on the Traun Bridge. Light rain and gray skies.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is Thursday, March 13 and it is more cloudy than yesterday. Looks like some rain is on its way- nature and farmers are eager for some moisture after this very dry Winter.&#xA;Thursday morning, right in the middle of the bridge over the Traun River. The water is calm, the sky is slightly cloudy. A hint of blue peeks through in the distance.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, March 12. No fog like yesterday. Much better :D&#xA;Picture taken on the middle of the bridge across the Traun River. Some high fog reflection off the smooth river.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, March 11. Even colder than yesterday and quite foggy.&#xA;Tuesday morning, right in the middle of the bridge over the Traun River. Smooth water but you can&amp;rsquo;t see much of the river because it is quite foggy today.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://iboard.github.io/images/bafkreicad52jvobs6vodmqn2bmvk6waglsyeo4gx55wsevhrcpy4okvjue.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Good Morning Internet!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a little bit colder than yesterday.&#xA;Monday morning, right in the middle of the bridge over the Traun River.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good Morning Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starting on March 9 I will post a picture taken at the same place every day during our daily morning walk along the river Traun in Upper Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we go &amp;hellip;&#xA;Sunday morning in the middle of the bridge across river Traun. Smooth water, clear sky with some contrails mirrored on the smooth river.&#xA;ALT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://iboard.github.io/images/bafkreigaza44gknvbmnok27uje7ieztp6xj7nprlbcflu2geyng2iat6l4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Good Morning Internet!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elixir in Production: A Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2023-01-30-elixir-in-production/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having run Elixir and Phoenix applications in production for several years now, I can confidently say it was the right choice. The stability of the BEAM, the performance of the applications, and the developer experience are all top-notch. The ecosystem has matured, and the community is one of the most welcoming and helpful I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been a part of. If you&amp;rsquo;re building for the long term, Elixir and Phoenix are a combination that&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building for the Future with Phoenix</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2020-05-25-phoenix-rising/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I got more comfortable with Elixir, I naturally gravitated towards the Phoenix framework. Building real-time, fault-tolerant web applications with Phoenix was a game-changer. The performance and scalability were unlike anything I had experienced before. LiveView, in particular, blew my mind. The ability to build interactive, real-time user interfaces with server-rendered HTML is a testament to the power and ingenuity of the Elixir ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm: Discovering Elixir</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of working with object-oriented languages, I stumbled upon Elixir in 2012 and it was a breath of fresh air. The functional programming paradigm, the actor model, and the BEAM VM were all new concepts to me. It took some time to wrap my head around it, but the elegance and concurrency of Elixir were undeniable. It felt like I was learning to program all over again, but in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Web Revolution and the Rise of PHP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the internet started to boom, my focus shifted to web development, and PHP was the language of the hour. It was a chaotic but exciting time. PHP made it incredibly easy to build dynamic websites. I remember the joy of seeing my code come to life in a web browser, creating interactive pages that could be accessed by anyone in the world. It was a paradigm shift from desktop applications to the global reach of the web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures in C&#43;&#43; and Object-Oriented Programming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After mastering the basics with Pascal, I dived into the world of C++. It was a huge leap, introducing me to the complexities of memory management and the power of object-oriented programming. I remember the long nights debugging pointers and the satisfaction of finally getting a complex program to compile and run. C++ was the language that opened my eyes to the performance and control that was possible, and it laid the groundwork for much of my later career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Steps in Programming: The Pascal Days</title>
      <link>https://iboard.github.io/archives/posts/2010-03-15-pascal-days/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back to the late 80s, my journey into the world of programming began with Pascal. It was a structured and strongly-typed language, which made it an excellent tool for learning the fundamentals of programming. I remember spending hours in front of a Turbo Pascal IDE, mesmerized by the blue screen and the power to create something out of nothing. From simple &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; programs to more complex data structures, Pascal taught me the importance of discipline and clear logic in coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
